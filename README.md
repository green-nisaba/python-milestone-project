# Tic-tac-toe Game
Tic-tac-toe is originally a  paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
